  <h1>About Me!</h1>

  <h2>Marcin Wrzoś</h2>
  <p>In my current role I am responsible for the improvement of the manual
  process in excel by writing macros in VBA. Working for over 3 years in
  investment banking taught me to work under pressure and handle tight
  deadlines. In these positions I have practiced my soft skills during calls
  with internal clients and hard skills. With that experience I am looking
  to transition into IT.</p>
